Our implemented code is based on the paper "Learning Fair Policies in Multiobjective (Deep) Reinforcement Learning with Average and Discounted Rewards".

Their original code are in "stable_baselines" folder.

Our implemented code include:
1. The predator-prey environment is in "predator-prey/so_abalone_env.py".
2. RL and Fair-RL agents are all in "stable_baselines3" folder, adapted from the "stable_baselines3" library.
3. The experiment exexution is in "exec_experiments.py".
4. The result analysis is in the notebook "AnalyzeResult.py"
